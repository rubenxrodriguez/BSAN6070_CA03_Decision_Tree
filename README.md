# BSAN6070_CA03_Decision_Tree

## Overview
This is an income classifier using a decision tree model. This model will predict whether individuals' income is greater or lower than 50k per year. The data comes from the Census Bureau, and has columns such as hours worked per week, education, race and sex, and age. The provided code first inspects the data to see if any cleaning is necessary, then it splits the data into training and testing splits.

## Necessary Libraries
* os (Version 3.13.1)
* Numpy (Version 1.18.0)
* Collections (import Counter)
* Pandas (Version 2.2.3)
* Scikit Learn (Version 1.6.1)
Scikit Learn (Naive Bayes section with MulitnomialNB function) (Version 1.6.1)
Scikit Learn (Metrics section with accuracy_score function) (Version 1.6.1)

## Dataset and Source Code
The dataset and source code was provided by Professor Brahma. I reused his code [specifically the make_dictionary and extract_features functions to prepare the training/test data for the Gaussian NB model. I added comments and double checked the accurary of the model. The source of this data is not given but a link is provided to download the zipped data : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ubxrG0QYYNQcs5GDNn9DiS38Kfc7N0Ws/view?usp=sharing. 

## Installation
Open the .ipynb file in your chosen environment, ensure that the data is in the same repository/working directory and then run the code.
